# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for your Chrome extension:

## Required Icons

- **`icon16.png`** - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- **`icon48.png`** - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- **`icon128.png`** - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Guidelines

- Use PNG format for best quality
- Ensure icons are square and properly sized
- Test how they look at different zoom levels
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 100KB each)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
- Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma)
- Online icon generators
- Icon libraries and resources

## Placeholder Icons

Until you create custom icons, you can:
1. Use simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Download free icons from icon libraries
3. Create basic geometric shapes

## Testing

After adding icons:
1. Reload the extension in Chrome
2. Check how they appear in the toolbar
3. Verify they display correctly in `chrome://extensions/`
